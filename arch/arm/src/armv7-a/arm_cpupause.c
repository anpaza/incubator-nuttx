/* These spinlocks are used in the SMP configuration in order to implement
 * up_cpu_pause().  The protocol for CPUn to pause CPUm is as follows
 *
 * 1. The up_cpu_pause() implementation on CPUn locks both g_cpu_wait[m]
 *    and g_cpu_paused[m].  CPUn then waits spinning on g_cpu_paused[m].
 * 2. CPUm receives the interrupt it (1) unlocks g_cpu_paused[m] and
 *    (2) locks g_cpu_wait[m].  The first unblocks CPUn and the second
 *    blocks CPUm in the interrupt handler.
 *
 * When CPUm resumes, CPUn unlocks g_cpu_wait[m] and the interrupt handler
 * on CPUm continues.  CPUm must, of course, also then unlock g_cpu_wait[m]
 * so that it will be ready for the next pause operation.

 * Name: up_cpu_paused
 *
 * Description:
 *   Handle a pause request from another CPU.  Normally, this logic is

 *   However, it is sometimes necessary necessary to perform the pending
 *   pause operation in other contexts where the interrupt cannot be taken
 *   in order to avoid deadlocks.
 *
 *   This function performs the following operations:
 *
 *   1. It saves the current task state at the head of the current assigned
 *      task list.
 *   2. It waits on a spinlock, then
 *   3. Returns from interrupt, restoring the state of the new task at the
 *      head of the ready to run list.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   cpu - The index of the CPU to be paused
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   On success, OK is returned.  Otherwise, a negated errno value indicating
 *   the nature of the failure is returned.
